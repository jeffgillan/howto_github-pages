# howto_github-pages

You can serve websites from Github repositories using Github Pages. 

With a free Github account, you have the ability to serve one website. The name of the repository you want to be a website should be called 'username.github.io'

For example, I created a personal resume website (forked from <academicpages/academicpages.github.io>).
